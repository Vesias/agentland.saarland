  - API reference

## Conclusion

The externally-managed-environment issue has been successfully addressed throughout the codebase. The system now properly handles PEP 668 restrictions by automatically using virtual environments when needed. This improves security, compatibility, and user experience across different Python distributions and versions.

Key improvements include:
1. Automatic detection and handling of externally-managed-environment errors
2. Consistent use of virtual environments for all Python operations
3. Comprehensive documentation and examples
4. Diagnostic tools for troubleshooting
5. Integration with the main SAAR chain infrastructure

These changes ensure that the Claude Neural Framework works correctly on modern Python distributions that implement PEP 668, including Debian 12+, Ubuntu 22.04+, and other Linux distributions with externally-managed Python environments.
