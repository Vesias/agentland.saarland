```

## Version Numbers

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Version numbers follow the pattern: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: Backwards-compatible new functionality
- **PATCH**: Backwards-compatible bug fixes

## Release Process

When creating a new release:

1. Move changes from Unreleased section to a new release section
2. Add the version number and release date
3. Create a new empty Unreleased section
4. Tag the release in Git
5. Update version number in package.json and other relevant files

## Change Aggregation

Changes from various memory updates in `progress.md` should be aggregated and summarized in the changelog. The memory updates provide detailed context and explanation, while the changelog offers a concise summary of significant changes.

## Integration with Memory Bank

The changelog should be synchronized with the memory bank system. When significant changes are made:

1. Add a memory update to `progress.md` with detailed context
2. Summarize the change in the changelog
3. Cross-reference between the memory update and changelog entry

Example integration:

```markdown
### Memory Update
<memory_update date="2025-05-15" source="Development" trigger="Feature Implementation">
Implemented multi-factor authentication with support for email, SMS, and authentication apps. This required changes to the user model, authentication service, and login flow. Extensive testing was performed to ensure backward compatibility with existing authentication methods.

The implementation uses Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) for authentication apps and secure token generation for email and SMS verification. The database schema was updated to store MFA preferences and secret keys securely.
</memory_update>

### Changelog Entry
## [1.2.0] - 2025-05-15

### Added
- Multi-factor authentication support for email, SMS, and authentication apps ([#145](https://github.com/agentland/saarland/pull/145))

## Automated Changelog Generation

Changelog generation can be partially automated by extracting information from:

1. Git commit messages
2. Pull request descriptions
3. Issue titles and descriptions
4. Memory bank updates

A script can aggregate this information and generate a draft changelog entry:

```javascript
// tools/scripts/generate-changelog.js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const { execSync } = require('child_process');

// Get the latest tag
const latestTag = execSync('git describe --tags --abbrev=0').toString().trim();

// Get all commits since the latest tag
const commits = execSync(`git log ${latestTag}..HEAD --pretty=format:"%h %s"`)
  .toString()
  .trim()
  .split('\n')
  .filter(Boolean);

// Categorize commits based on conventional commit format
const categories = {
  added: [],
  changed: [],
  deprecated: [],
  removed: [],
  fixed: [],
  security: []
};

// Regex patterns for categorizing commits
const patterns = {
  added: /^feat(\([^)]+\))?:/,
  changed: /^(refactor|perf|style)(\([^)]+\))?:/,
  deprecated: /^deprecate(\([^)]+\))?:/,
  removed: /^remove(\([^)]+\))?:/,
  fixed: /^fix(\([^)]+\))?:/,
  security: /^security(\([^)]+\))?:/
};

// Categorize commits
commits.forEach(commit => {
  const [hash, message] = commit.split(' ');
  const commitUrl = `https://github.com/agentland/saarland/commit/${hash}`;
  
  for (const [category, pattern] of Object.entries(patterns)) {
    if (pattern.test(message)) {
      const formattedMessage = message.replace(pattern, '').trim();
      categories[category].push(`- ${formattedMessage} ([${hash}](${commitUrl}))`);
      break;
    }
  }
});

// Generate changelog content
let changelogContent = `## [Unreleased]\n\n`;

for (const [category, entries] of Object.entries(categories)) {
  if (entries.length > 0) {
    changelogContent += `### ${category.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + category.slice(1)}\n`;
    entries.forEach(entry => {
      changelogContent += `${entry}\n`;
    });
    changelogContent += '\n';
  }
}

// Prepend to existing changelog
const changelogPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'CHANGELOG.md');
const existingChangelog = fs.readFileSync(changelogPath, 'utf8');
const headerEnd = existingChangelog.indexOf('## [Unreleased]');
const newChangelog = existingChangelog.slice(0, headerEnd) + changelogContent + existingChangelog.slice(existingChangelog.indexOf('## ['), existingChangelog.length);

fs.writeFileSync(changelogPath, newChangelog);

console.log('Changelog updated successfully!');
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Entries Concise**: Focus on what changed and why
2. **Use Present Tense**: Write in present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
3. **Group Related Changes**: Organize changes logically
4. **Reference Issues**: Link to relevant issues or pull requests
5. **Credit Contributors**: Acknowledge contributions from the community
6. **Maintain Chronology**: Keep changes in reverse chronological order
7. **Be Comprehensive**: Include all significant changes
8. **Regular Updates**: Update the changelog with each release
9. **Review Changes**: Review changelog entries for accuracy
10. **User Perspective**: Focus on what matters to users

## Conclusion

A well-maintained changelog provides valuable information for users, developers, and stakeholders about the evolution of the project. By following this template and guidelines, agentland.saarland maintains a clear, consistent record of changes that helps users understand the project's development history.
